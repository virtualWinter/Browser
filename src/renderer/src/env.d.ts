/**
 * @file Environment type definitions for the Vite client.
 * This triple-slash directive imports type definitions provided by Vite,
 * which are essential for TypeScript to understand Vite-specific features
 * like environment variables (`import.meta.env`) and asset imports
 * (e.g., `import logo from './logo.svg'`).
 *
 * It ensures that TypeScript can correctly type-check code that uses these
 * Vite client-side APIs.
